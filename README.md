### Hi there 👋

I'm currently attending UCLA as a Computer Science(2022) major. I recently switched my major from Electrical Engineering to 
Computer Science because I have realized that my passion lies within all things software! My most valuable strengths 
consist of creative problem solving, communication, and collaboration. I have had experience working at established companies 
such as Qualcomm and Raytheon to startups such as PacificSky Solar. I am actively seeking internship positions for 
Fall 2020, Spring 2021 and Summer 2021.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on the Linux Kernel Baseport team @Qualcomm
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about the various procedures/practices that are required to upstream patches
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on anything software related!
